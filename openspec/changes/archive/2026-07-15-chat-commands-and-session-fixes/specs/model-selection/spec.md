## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: User can switch the active model at runtime
The server SHALL accept a `set_model` WebSocket message OR a `/model <id>` chat command and switch the agent session's active model via the SDK's runtime model-switch API, validating that the requested model is available and has configured auth. A `/model` command with no argument SHALL report the currently active model. The switched model SHALL apply to the next agent turn. (Model switching is rejected while the agent is streaming, per the dedicated streaming-guard requirement.)

#### Scenario: user selects a valid model via the selector
- **WHEN** a client sends `{ "type": "set_model", "id": "deepseek-v4-flash" }` for a model in the available list
- **THEN** the server SHALL switch the session's active model and broadcast `model_changed` with the new id

#### Scenario: user switches model via the /model command
- **WHEN** a client sends `{ "type": "prompt", "text": "/model deepseek-v4-pro" }` for a model in the available list
- **THEN** the server SHALL switch the session's active model and broadcast `model_changed` with the new id
- **AND** SHALL broadcast a `command_use` event for the `model` command

#### Scenario: /model with no argument reports the current model
- **WHEN** a client sends `{ "type": "prompt", "text": "/model" }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL broadcast a `command_use` event reporting the currently active model
- **AND** SHALL NOT switch the model

#### Scenario: user selects an unknown model
- **WHEN** a client sends `set_model` or `/model nonexistent` for a model not in the available list
- **THEN** the server SHALL send an `error` message and the active model SHALL remain unchanged

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Model selector is enabled as soon as models are known
The chat UI SHALL enable the model selector as soon as the available models are received, not only after the first agent turn completes. The selector SHALL be disabled while the agent is streaming and re-enabled when the turn ends (whether it succeeded or failed). The selector SHALL reflect the currently active model.

#### Scenario: selector enabled on connect
- **WHEN** the page loads and the server sends the model list
- **THEN** the model selector SHALL be enabled
- **AND** SHALL reflect the currently active model

#### Scenario: selector re-enabled after a failed turn
- **WHEN** an agent turn ends with an error
- **THEN** the model selector SHALL be re-enabled
