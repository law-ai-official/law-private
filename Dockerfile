# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# ── Full-stack single-container image for Platform ────────────────────────────
#
# Bundles the backend (server.js) AND its sidecars (LiteLLM + OpenConnector +
# Postgres) into ONE container. The supervisor (scripts/start.js → local-services.js
# → supervisor/lifecycle.js) spawns each sidecar as a child process on localhost,
# exactly like `npm start` does locally — one image, one process tree, one PVC.
#
#   docker build -t harbor.local/paas_private/platform .
#   docker run -p 3000:3000 -v platform-data:/data harbor.local/paas_private/platform
#
# Multi-stage: the builder compiles native addons + builds web/dist + builds all
# Linux bundled resources (`npm run predist`); the runtime stage copies only what
# is needed. Node 25 is used in BOTH stages: the same major the release.yml CI
# uses, AND the lockfile was generated under npm 11 (Node 22's npm 10 misreads
# it — "Missing: zod@... from lock file"). The system Node ABI then matches the
# native addons compiled at `npm ci` time (better-sqlite3, tree-sitter); the
# supervisor runs server.js + sidecars on the system Node (process.execPath), so
# the bundled standalone Node (resources/node) is built for verify-bundle but not
# used at runtime.
